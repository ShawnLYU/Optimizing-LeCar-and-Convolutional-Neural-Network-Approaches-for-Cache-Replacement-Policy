## Getting Started

These repo will get you a copy of both our models. Sample data is provided here for to get your hands dirty.


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- Python 3.7.0
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- Numpy, Sklearn, Pandas





## Running the tests

In Neural networks, there are two pre-trained models: MLP and CNN. In each folder, there is a Jupyter Notebook where you could load the model and make predictions.
